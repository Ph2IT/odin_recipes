        <img src="dal.jpeg"PICTURE OF COOKED DAL>

        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>Dal originated in India to mean lentils. It can be cooked in a few different ways, depending on the region. It is mainly made as a soup with tomatoes and onions, and various spices included, however, in south India, this dish is cooked plain and eaten with rice as the start of a meal.</p>
        <p>Dal is never eaten by itself, though it can be, and always paired with chapatis or rotis, or just rice. In south India, dal is also used to make another dish, sambar, which is also a soup but eaten with rice or other Indian delicacies.</p>
